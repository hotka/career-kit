# Resume Best Practices

## Structure
- Keep it 1-2 pages (1 page for <5 years experience)
- Use ATS-friendly format (no tables, columns, or graphics)
- Standard sections: Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects

## Writing Style
- Start bullets with action verbs
- Quantify achievements (numbers, percentages)
- Focus on impact, not just responsibilities
- Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

## Technical Skills
- Group by category (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, Databases)
- List only technologies you can discuss in depth
- Prioritize relevant skills for target role

## Experience Section
- Reverse chronological order
- Include company, title, location, dates
- 3-5 bullet points per role
- Emphasize recent roles (last 5-7 years)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Typos and grammatical errors
- Vague statements ("worked on", "helped with")
- Missing metrics and outcomes
- Including irrelevant information
- Using personal pronouns ("I", "me", "my")
