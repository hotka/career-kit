## Resume Writing Tips

### Action Verbs by Seniority

**Junior/Mid-Level:**
Developed, Built, Implemented, Created, Designed, Integrated, Configured, Maintained, Tested, Debugged

**Senior/Staff-Level:**
Architected, Led, Established, Pioneered, Spearheaded, Drove, Mentored, Standardized, Scaled, Optimized

### Quantification Examples

- Users: "serving 50K+ users", "supporting 100+ team members"
- Performance: "improving response time by 60%", "reducing load time from 3s to 800ms"
- Scale: "handling 1M+ requests/day", "processing 500K transactions/hour"
- Cost: "reducing infrastructure costs by $5K/month", "saving 20 hours/week"
- Quality: "increasing test coverage from 40% to 85%", "reducing production bugs by 50%"

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

1. **Use standard section headers:** "Professional Experience", "Education", "Technical Skills"
2. **Include keywords** from job description
3. **Avoid graphics, tables, or columns** (ATS can't parse them)
4. **Use standard fonts:** Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman
5. **Save as .docx or .pdf** (PDF preferred if ATS-compatible)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Vague statements: "Worked on various projects"
✅ Specific: "Developed 5 microservices handling 2M+ daily transactions"

❌ Technical jargon without context: "Implemented K8s with Istio"
✅ Business context: "Deployed containerized application with Kubernetes, reducing deployment time by 75%"

❌ Missing metrics: "Improved application performance"
✅ Quantified: "Optimized database queries, improving page load time by 60%"

❌ Passive voice: "Was responsible for building features"
✅ Active voice: "Built authentication system serving 50K+ users"

❌ Too long: 2+ pages for <10 years experience
✅ Concise: 1 page for <5 years, 2 pages max for 5-10 years

### Length Guidelines

- **New Grad / 0-3 years:** 1 page
- **Mid-Level / 3-7 years:** 1-2 pages
- **Senior / 7-12 years:** 2 pages
- **Staff+ / 12+ years:** 2 pages (focus on recent 10 years)

### Tailoring for Different Roles

**Backend-Heavy Role:**
- Emphasize API design, database optimization, system architecture
- Highlight scalability, performance, reliability achievements

**Frontend-Heavy Role:**
- Emphasize UI/UX, component development, performance optimization
- Highlight user-facing features, accessibility, responsive design

**Full-Stack Role:**
