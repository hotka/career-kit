# LinkedIn Profile Optimizer

Analyze and optimize LinkedIn profiles for maximum visibility and job search effectiveness.

## When to Use

- User asks to review/analyze their LinkedIn profile
- User wants to improve their Headline or About section
- User needs to increase profile visibility for recruiters
- User wants to build strategic networking plan
- User asks about "Open to Work" settings or profile completeness

## Profile Analysis Framework

When analyzing a LinkedIn profile, evaluate these areas:

### Profile Completeness Checklist

| Element | Required | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Professional photo | Yes | High |
| Custom banner | Nice-to-have | Medium |
| Headline (220 chars) | Yes | High |
| About section | Yes | High |
| Current position | Yes | High |
| Past positions | Yes | High |
| Education | Yes | Medium |
| Skills (50 max) | Yes | Medium |
| Location | Yes | High |
| Contact info | Yes | Low |

**Goal**: Achieve "All-Star" profile status for maximum search ranking.

---

## Headline Optimization

**Purpose**: First impression + search ranking keywords

### Headline Structure

```
[Role] | [Experience/Specialization] | [Key Technologies/Domain] | [Optional: Achievement]
```

**Examples for developers**:
- `Engineering Manager | 5+ years E-commerce | Teams up to 50 | Java, Scala`
- `Software Engineer | iOS Developer | Swift lover`
- `Senior Frontend Developer | React, TypeScript | Fintech & SaaS`
- `Full-Stack Developer | Node.js, React | Building scalable B2B products`

### Headline Principles

1. **Lead with target role**, not company name
2. **Include keywords** recruiters search for
3. **2-4 short phrases**, separated by | or •
4. **Specific > Generic**: "React Developer" beats "Software Engineer"
5. **Can mention notable companies**: "Ex-Google" or "Stanford"
6. **From broad to specific**: Role → Experience → Technologies

### For Job Seekers

❌ Don't write: "Looking for new opportunities"
✅ Do write: Your target role + key qualifications

---

## About Section Optimization

**Purpose**: Expanded Summary + keywords + personality

### About Structure (3 parts)

```
Part 1: Who I am + what I do + for whom + expertise (2-3 sentences)
Part 2: Background highlights + key achievements with numbers (3-5 bullets)
Part 3 (optional): Key skills list + links to portfolio
```

### About Writing Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Write in first person | Copy resume verbatim |
| Include personality | Write generic statements |
| Add specific metrics | List every skill |
| Use bullets for readability | Write wall of text |
| Include call-to-action | Forget contact info |

### About Template

```
I'm a [Role] with [X years] of experience in [Domain/Industry].

I specialize in [specific expertise] and have worked with [types of companies/products].

Key highlights:
• [Achievement 1 with metric]
• [Achievement 2 with metric]
• [Achievement 3 with metric]

Technologies: [Key stack]

[Optional: What I'm looking for / How to reach me]
```

### Example About for Frontend Developer

| Resume | LinkedIn |

### Experience Block Structure

1. **Company name** with logo (auto-populated)
2. **Your title** (use target role keywords)
3. **Dates** (Month Year - Present)
4. **Description**: Company context + your achievements

### Company Description Template
